This is a repo containing the code used to build
and run an interactive webserver proffering up the
nightly (daily) Mt. Hamilton sky camera feeds.

Is server-intensive, since you end up serving
many HTML5 videos simultaneously.  Worked well
when files were being served off of a
PCIe-connected SSD, but really swamped my 4-core
server and ate a bunch of ram.
